## Phase 1: Install idb_kval Package ✅ COMPLETE

**Date:** 2025-01-14
**Tasks Completed:** 2/2

### What Was Done

- Installed `idb-keyval` package (v6.2.2) using `bun add idb-keyval`
  - Note: Package name is `idb-keyval` not `idb_kval` (plan had incorrect name)
- Verified package in package.json dependencies
- Verified `bun install` completes without errors

### Key Finding

The PLAN.md document references the package as `idb_kval` but the correct npm package name is `idb-keyval`. This has been noted for future phases.

### Success Criteria Met

✅ All success criteria met for Phase 1
